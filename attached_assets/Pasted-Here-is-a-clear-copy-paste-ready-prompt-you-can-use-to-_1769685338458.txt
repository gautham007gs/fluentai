## 🔥 Shorter Prompt (If You Want a Quick Result)

> Build a language-learning chat website where users select their known language and target language. User messages are translated into the target language before being sent. AI replies in the target language and shows the translation in the known language. The UI should be simple, responsive, and beginner-friendly.

## 💡 Tip (Very Important)

If you’re using **ChatGPT API**, your **system prompt** should include:

```text
You are a language learning assistant.
Always respond in the user’s selected learning language.
Also provide a clear translation in the user’s known language.
Keep sentences simple and conversational.
```
